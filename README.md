## Deployment

[Website is deployed here](https://mov-look-webtech.onrender.com/). Please keep in mind that the website is deployed on a free instance of Render, and can therefore take a while to spin up.

## App description

MovLook is a movie lookup website/ catalogue. Its functionality is simple - users can search for movies, tv-shows or animations and then view their details (such as release date, actors, genre, rating, etc). 

You can type in a name of a movie (or a part of the name) into the search bar and press "enter" to search. After getting a list of results containing movie name and image, you can click "show details" to view more details about the chosen movie.
